### :date: Day 1 06/18/2019:

**What I did:** Today I decided to dive into Python, using Zero to Hero in Python 3 off of Udemy. Spent most of my time setting up my environment. I am using a custom built PC with dual monitors and a Dell Latitude 7480 for hardware. For software I am using sublime text and anaconda. 

**Thoughts:** Glad I finally decided to go from watching to actually doing. Didnt do anything major, but little drops of water make a mighty ocean.

**Link(s) to Anaconda:** [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

**Link(s) to Sublime Text:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
