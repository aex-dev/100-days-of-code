### :date: Day 1:
06/18/2019

**What I did:** Today I decided to dive into Python, using Zero to Hero in Python 3 off of Udemy. Spent most of my time setting up my environment. I am using a custom built PC with dual monitors and a Dell Latitude 7480 for hardware. For software I am using sublime text and anaconda. 

**Thoughts:** Glad I finally decided to go from watching to actually doing. Didnt do anything major, but little drops of water make a mighty ocean.

**What I did:** Today I did not do much coding, it was more about learning the basics regarding Python objects and data structures. There were two hours worth of video to go through but I sped it up to 1.25 speed. I got most of section 3 done.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the basics felt easy to digest. I ended up doing like an hour and 30 minutes, should probably move some stuff around in my schedule. (I schedule my days in 30 minute blocks)
